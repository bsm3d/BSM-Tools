BSM Tools Suite
Unity HDRP Extensions & Utilities
Version 1.0 - 2025

Welcome
=======
Welcome to the BSM Tools collection. This comprehensive toolset, representing hundreds of development hours, is designed to enhance your Unity experience, streamline your workflow, and fuel your creativity. Created by technical artists, for technical artists in the video game, film, and VFX industries, this collection enhances your Unity work environment with additional features.

These tools are built on the best practices from professional 3D practices to streamline your production pipeline.

Origins and Purpose
=================
Working extensively in both Film and cinematic production with Unity, I encountered a persistent challenge: while Unity offers powerful capabilities for visual creation, many of its tools require programming knowledge that artists shouldn't need to have. This observation led me to develop the BSM Tools Suite, a collection of thoroughly tested, dependency-free scripts that serve both artists seeking ready-to-use tools and technical artists requiring flexible, programmable solutions.

Two Worlds, One Solution
----------------------
The BSM Tools Suite uniquely bridges the gap between immediate usability and technical flexibility. For artists, it provides intuitive, ready-to-use tools accessible directly through Unity's interface. For technical artists and developers, it offers robust, well-documented functions that can be integrated into custom solutions and extended to meet specific project needs.

Installation Guide
================

Quick Start
----------
You have two methods to install BSM Tools, please note you can put the needed file anywhere in Unity if you don't use BSM Tools Suite:

Method 1: Direct Script Installation
1. Create a folder structure: Assets/BSM Tools/includes
2. Copy the desired script files into the BSM Tools folder
3. Ensure the 'includes' folder contains all core functionality files
4. Delete any unused scripts (except those in the includes folder)

Method 2: Package Manager Installation
1. Open Unity Package Manager (Window > Package Manager)
2. Add package from git URL or local tarball
3. Select components to import
4. Remove unused scripts as needed (preserving the includes folder)

Important Notes:
- The 'includes' folder must remain intact when using any BSM scripts
- Scripts outside the includes folder can be safely removed if unused
- No dependencies exist between scripts - each functions independently
- All scripts are compatible with Unity 6.x HDRP

Best Practices
============

For Artists
---------
- Start with default settings and adjust gradually
- Use the Inspector interface for all modifications
- Save preferred settings as presets
- Utilize real-time preview features
- Keep unused scripts removed for clarity

For Technical Artists
------------------
- Review script documentation before implementation
- Test modifications in isolation
- Maintain script independence
- Optimize performance-critical sections
- Document custom implementations

Performance Considerations
=======================
- All scripts are optimized and probably ready for production use
- Memory allocation is minimized
- Batch operations where possible
- Script execution order is considered
- Debug features can be disabled for release

Troubleshooting
=============
Common Issues and Solutions:
1. Script Missing Reference:
   - Verify includes folder is present
   - Check script location in project
   - Ensure correct Unity version

2. Performance Issues:
   - Review debug settings
   - Check for multiple instances
   - Verify settings optimization

3. Visual Artifacts:
   - Confirm HDRP setup
   - Review render pipeline settings
   - Check effect parameters

Technical Specifications
=====================
Environment Requirements:
- Unity 6.x HDRP
- Minimal memory footprint
- No external dependencies

Security and Trust:
- Protection mechanisms intentionally omitted
